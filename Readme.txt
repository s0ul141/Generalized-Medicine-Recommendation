Our "Generalized Medicine Recommendation" 
project is an innovative endeavor aimed at improving healthcare 
delivery by harnessing the power of data-driven insights. In the 
ever-evolving landscape of medical treatment, this project seeks 
to develop a versatile recommendation system that aids 
healthcare providers in making informed and personalized 
medication choices for their patients. Rather than focusing on a 
single medical condition or patient demographic, our approach is 
"generalized," designed to cater to some extent of broad 
spectrum of healthcare scenarios. We aim to create a user-friendly interface that empowers healthcare professionals with 
evidence-based insights, facilitating more precise and patient centric treatment decisions. Leveraging advanced machine 
learning algorithms and a diverse dataset which contains 
information about, BMI, height, weight, age, blood groups, 
patient's medical history, allergies, and current health conditions 
to provide comprehensive medication recommendations.
The project focuses on the health care data analysis and 
medication recommendation, as we are trying to automate the 
process of getting medications for common disease such as 
fever, cough/cold and gastric problems etc., for the common 
people who live in rural areas or have less/ no knowledge 
about the medicines. There are several recommendation 
systems available in the literature, few of them have been 
considered in this project as per the relevance of the topic.
